(i, ii) Developed Code
	Written in Python given in the folder: Code (Version 4)
	Input video is also in the code folder: video.mp4
	Intermediate results and testing codes: Read Report for usage, explanations and screenshots of results.
!	Final result inside the code folder: video_processed.mp4
!	The actual main code is divided into 3: 
		0_frame_sampling: Takes video.mp4 samples and saves frames into subfolder "frames"
		1_frame_analysis_V4: Only this frame_analysis code should be used. It takes "frames" and saves "frames_processed"
		2_frames_to_video: Stitches back the processed frames into the video_processed.mp4.

Note: 1_frame_analysis_V4.py code takes about 1-2 hours to execute. (Intel i7 + 16GB RAM)
Note: variables.py holds all the tuned parameters for the code.
Note: At the end of variables.py a v4_dbg_flag exists. This should be changed to 1 for a better debugging output for test_4 only.


(iii) Report
	File named Report.pdf
	Designed to be read as pseudocode or read side to side with the original code.
	All instructions on reading alongside codes are written inside the report.

(iv) Slides
	File named Presentation.pptx

(v) Old Versions
	Includes the code base for version 3 that implements obstruction rejection for detected balls.
	This feature was depreciated when upgrading to version 4 (Not part of the final output)
	   but as explained in the report it is a novel idea that shouldn't be scrapped.
	Necessary information is given inside the Report for explanation and usage.
